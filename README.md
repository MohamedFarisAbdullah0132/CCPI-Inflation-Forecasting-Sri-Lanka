# CCPI Inflation Forecasting – Sri Lanka

## 📊 Project Overview
This project conducts a comparative study of traditional regression and machine learning models to forecast the Sri Lanka Consumer Price Index (CCPI). In addition, a PCA-based Macroeconomic Condition Index (MCI) is developed to summarize overall economic conditions.

The study covers monthly data from **January 2014 to December 2023** and focuses on key macroeconomic indicators relevant to inflation dynamics in Sri Lanka.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Forecast CCPI using Multiple Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost
- Compare predictive performance across models
- Construct a PCA-based Macroeconomic Condition Index (MCI)
- Interpret machine learning models using SHAP values
- Visualize results via an interactive Power BI dashboard

## 📁 Data Sources
- Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL)
- Department of Census and Statistics (DCS)
- Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA)
- World Bank / IMF (for verification)

## 🧠 Methodology
1. Data collection and preprocessing
2. Exploratory data analysis
3. PCA for Macroeconomic Condition Index construction
4. Model development:
